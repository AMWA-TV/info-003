This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- It introduces a common format choice approach of some physical interfaces into NMOS

### Why does it matter?

- It shows how physical protocols of common format choice can be handled in the networked way

### How does it work?

- Receivers expose information about their Capabilities based on EDID
- Senders get a control mechanism which allows to configure their actual media parameters described in Flows and Sources
